WebDAV stands for Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning.
It is a set of HTTP based methods used for collaborative management of
files and directories on a remote server.
GNU MyServer is WebDAV compliant; that said, you can use a webdav
client to manage your data on the server.

As a first step, you must enable webdav. To do that, set the value of
``http.webdav.enable'' in @file{myserver.xml} file as ``YES'':

@example
<DEFINE name="http.webdav.enable" value="YES"/>
@end example

@section Commands.
While the exact syntax to execute various webdav functions maybe
client dependant, the basic implementation remains the same.
Some of the webdav commands that myserver supports are:

status codes returned are:
